  {
    keywords: ["wbs", "work breakdown structure", "schedule", "p6", "planning", "critical path"],
    question: "How do I create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?",
    answer: `To create an effective WBS for construction:
1. Identify the major project deliverables (e.g., Substructure, Superstructure, MEP, Finishes).
2. Decompose deliverables into sub-components (e.g., Superstructure -> Columns, Slabs, Beams).
3. Break down further into actionable work packages (e.g., Slabs -> Formwork, Rebar, Concrete Pour, Curing).
4. Assign estimated durations and dependencies (predecessors/successors) for the Critical Path Method (CPM).
Let me know the project type, and I can draft a specific WBS for you!`,

  {
    keywords: ["evm", "earned value", "spi", "cpi", "cost performance", "schedule performance"],
    question: "How do I calculate EVM (Earned Value Management)?",
    answer: `Earned Value Management (EVM) tracks project performance against the baseline.
Key formulas:
• PV (Planned Value) = Authorized budget assigned to scheduled work.
• EV (Earned Value) = Budget authorized for work actually completed.
• AC (Actual Cost) = Actual cost incurred for the completed work.
• SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = EV / PV. (SPI < 1 means behind schedule)
• CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC. (CPI < 1 means over budget)
Provide your PV, EV, and AC, and I will analyze the variances for you.`,

    keywords: ["fidic", "eot", "extension of time", "claim", "delay"],
    question: "How do I process an Extension of Time (EOT) claim under FIDIC?",
    answer: `Under FIDIC (e.g., Red Book 1999/2017), the procedure for an EOT is:
1. Notice: The Contractor must give notice of the delay event within 28 days of becoming aware of it (Sub-Clause 20.1 / 20.2).
2. Detailed Claim: Submit a fully detailed claim within 42 days (or agreed time), including schedule delay analysis and supporting records.
3. Engineer's Determination: The Engineer reviews and responds within 42 days, either approving in principle or requesting more info.
Always support claims with a time-impact analysis on the approved baseline schedule. Need help drafting the Notice of Delay? Just ask.`,

1. Safe Work Procedure (Method Statement): Step-by-step sequence of the task, resources required, and responsibilities.
2. Risk Assessment: Identify hazards (e.g., falling from height, electrical shock).
3. Risk Rating: Assess Probability vs Impact.
4. Mitigation & Controls: Hierarchy of controls (Elimination, Substitution, Engineering Controls, Admin Controls, PPE).
5. Emergency Rescue Plan & Permit to Work (PTW) requirements.

1. Identify and document the deviation from the approved drawing or specification.
2. Issue the NCR to the responsible party instantly, with photos/evidence.
3. Request a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) from the contractor including Root Cause Analysis.
4. Review and approve the proposed rework/repair method.
5. Re-inspect after the rework and formally close the NCR on the quality log.

  // Budget & Cost
  {
    keywords: ["budget", "cost", "price", "estimate", "how much", "construction cost"],
    question: "How is the budget estimated?",
    answer: `SIID uses intelligent budget estimation based on multiple factors:

**Cost Tiers:**
• **Moderate**: ₹1,500/sqft - Basic quality, essential features
• **Intermediate**: ₹2,200/sqft - Good quality, standard features
• **Premium**: ₹3,000/sqft - High-end materials, luxury features
